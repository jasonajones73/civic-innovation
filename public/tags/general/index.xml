      <description>Summary of problem: When attempting to understand programs, services and even taxes it can be incredibly difficult to delineate between Guilford County and the municipalities that are contained within. Citizens generally have a difficult time understanding who to contact and in some cases may feel hindered or discouraged by this lack of understanding. We do a good job of providing information on our website but citizens would need to know what they are looking for to access it.</description>
