      <description>Summary of problem: We are constantly seeking innovative ideas or solutions to improve the security at Guilford County locations for employees, citizens and visitors. There is no specific problem to point to, rather a general desire to continually improve safety/security. Engaging diverse perspectives is important to expand our understanding of any area where we are seeking improvement.
How it affects the organization: Security needs are constantly evolving and the methods/technologies used to meet those needs are constantly evolving as well.</description>
