      <description>Local governments across the country have become a platform for experimentation. The explosion of innovation within local government is in response to a limited resource supply and an increase in demand for better service. With its combination of resources, authority, influence, and accountability, some local governments are stepping up to the challenge to deliver better service to more people, faster.
Pilot projects supported by philanthropic dollars are an emerging method for encouraging innovation in local government operations and services.</description>

      <description>The purpose of this competition is closely related to Joy&amp;rsquo;s Law. Attributed to Sun Microsystems co-founder Bill Joy, the law states that no matter who you are, most of the smartest people work for someone else. Recognizing that there is collectively more knowledge outside of our organization than inside of it just makes sense.
This competition is seeking creative solutions to local government challenges and is prioritizing valuable interactions with local students.</description>
