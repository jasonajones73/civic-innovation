The purpose of this competition is closely related to Joy's Law. Attributed to Sun Microsystems co-founder Bill Joy, the law states that **no matter who you are, most of the smartest people work for someone else**. Recognizing that there is collectively more knowledge outside of our organization than inside of it just makes sense.

This competition is seeking creative solutions to local government challenges and is prioritizing valuable interactions with local students. At the same time, we recognize the value in creating a unique opportunity for students to pursue non-traditional paths into entrepreneurship. Public servants are incredibly devoted to the work that they do every day and care deeply about serving citizens. This is a good thing but can also create blocks that prevent us from thinking differently about the problems we are facing. This will hopefully provide us with a great opportunity to challenge both students and public servants in a new way.

Check out the problem statements and help us develop innovative solutions!
