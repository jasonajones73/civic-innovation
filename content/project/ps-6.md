## Summary of problem:

We are constantly seeking innovative ideas or solutions to improve the security at Guilford County locations for employees, citizens and visitors. There is no specific problem to point to, rather a general desire to continually improve safety/security. Engaging diverse perspectives is important to expand our understanding of any area where we are seeking improvement. 

## How it affects the organization:

Security needs are constantly evolving and the methods/technologies used to meet those needs are constantly evolving as well. Although we try to keep up as much as possible, we operate with limited resources and staff making it difficult at times to innovate.

## Current state of problem:

Security enhancements can be very expensive and difficult to deploy with limited resources. This is complicated further by the fact that Guilford County operates facilities in Greensboro, High Point and other areas in the county. It is always advantageous for us to explore innovative ideas and diverse perspectives when considering ways in which we could improve overall security/safety.

## Ideal state and its benefits:

An ideal situation would be one that incrementally or dramatically improves security for employees/citizens in Guilford County facilities in a low-cost and easy to deploy fashion.
