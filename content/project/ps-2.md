## Summary of problem:

We currently rely on a manual process of calling sites for their best estimations of wait-times which is time consuming and not accurate. Currently this information is also not reported back out to the public in real-time.

## How it affects the organization:

The manual collection of this information is time consuming and mostly inaccurate. This decreases real-time flexibility in resource allocation, hinders our ability to identify problems quickly and makes it difficult to respond to media inquiries at times.

## Current state of problem:

Currently, wait-times are collected manually via phone calls and rely on visual approximations. These wait-times are currently not reported back out to the public in real time.

## Ideal state and its benefits:

Voters would be able to see wait-times on our website in real time. This could be utilized by voters, especially during early voting, to plan appropriately and utilize previously underutilized voting sites.
