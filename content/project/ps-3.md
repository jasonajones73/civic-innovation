## Summary of problem:

We utilize up to 20 field technicians on election day, whose duties vary between voting machine repair, to resupply support, to other election procedure assistance.  Some are based in the office and deployed by a supervisor to an area of need.  Others have a “territory” in which they operate. Currently, we are not able to track these technicians to most efficiently deploy them.

## How it affects the organization:

Most significant impact is that we are not able to most effectively optimize the deployment of our field technicians on Election Day.

## Current state of problem:

Currently, field technicians are manually deployed based on a general understanding of their location/territory. Task prioritization and deployment locations are manually considered.

## Ideal state and its benefits:

Ideal situation would be the ability to track the location of all field technicians, deploy technicians without the need to check back in at the office and to prioritize those deployments based on problem and consideration of the current status and location of all field technicians.
