## Summary of problem:

We do not currently have any Alexa Skills or Google Actions for Guilford County citizens or visitors to access and utilize. 

## How it affects the organization:

It limits the ability of citizens and visitors to access services, programs and general information.

## Current state of problem:

Information Services has considered this problem for some time now and considers it to be a significant need. At this time, we have not developed or deployed any solutions. 

## Ideal state and its benefits:

An ideal state might be one that allows citizens and visitors to use Alexa Skills and/or Google Actions to access Guilford County services, programs and information. As an incremental step forward, it would be great to see a business case for this developed by deploying simple Skills or Actions that allow users to access basic information about county services.
